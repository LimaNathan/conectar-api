feat: Implement user authentication and registration

This commit introduces user authentication and registration functionalities, including JWT-based authentication, validation, and necessary DTOs.

Key features and changes include:
- **Auth Module:** Implemented an `auth` module with JWT-based authentication, including a `JwtStrategy` for validating tokens.
- **User Module:** Updated the `user` module to export the `UserService` and include the `PrismaService`.
- **Controllers:** Added `register` and `login` endpoints to the `AuthController`.
- **DTOs:** Created and updated DTOs for user authentication, creation, and payload, with the addition of `class-validator` for input validation.
- **Dependencies:** Added `class-validator` to handle input validation.
- **Linting:** Updated ESLint configuration with a new rule.
